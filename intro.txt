This is a really simple deploy of memory match game on Shiny. According to the difficulty user selected, different numbers of pairs of digits were chosen, random shuffled, masked with "X". In each turns of guesses, the user can click two of "X" to see the digits masked. If they are same, the two digits will be unmasked. If they are different, the two digits will be turned back to "X" when the next turns of guesses begins. The user keeps on matching the same digits until all the pairs of digits are discovered. The turns of guesses the user used will be shown during the game.
